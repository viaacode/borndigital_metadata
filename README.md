# Metadata model for digital intake
***Work In Progress!***

This guide gives the Content Partners (CPs) of VIAA more insight how metadata is structured inside VIAAs MAM. CPs that have  borndigital or digitised material will need to deliver metadata about these essences. This is done by supplying a sidecar XML for every essence, e.g. test.xml + test.mxf. VIAAs ingest proces expects metadata that is already mapped to the VIAA metadata model that is explained below.

Here you can find a XSD to validate your mapping, examples and explination of all the metadata fields.
